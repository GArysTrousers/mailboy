```

### ‚ö° Templates
You can create templates for your emails by placing a file named (template-name).html in the templates folder, then in your POST request, specify the name of the template you'd like to use.

A template can contain {{body}}, which will be replaced by the html specified in the POST body.

An example template called 'basic' is included.
